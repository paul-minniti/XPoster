## Troubleshooting

- **Button not appearing?**
  - Make sure the extension is enabled in your browser's extension settings.
  - Try refreshing the X.com page.
  - Sometimes, X.com updates its website, which might temporarily affect the button's placement. We try to keep up!
- **Reply not generating or error message?**
  - The AI might be busy, or there might be a temporary connection issue. Try again in a few moments.
  - If the button shows "Error", it will reset itself after a couple of seconds for you to try again.

If you continue to have issues, please let us know!
